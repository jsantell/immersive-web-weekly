  Oh, hi, I didn't see you come in. It's been awhile. But it is 2019!
  And there have been a lot of updates and progress on the [WebXR Device API]!
  Enjoy, my winter and summer pals.

    title: Real-world Hit Testing merged into WebXR
    url: https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/8e1c06511b420a30d34878c472416bd604747cb9/hit-testing-explainer.md

      While several augmented reality APIs have been incubating over the last few months
      ([hit test](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test),
      [lighting estimation](https://github.com/immersive-web/lighting-estimation),
      [anchors](https://github.com/immersive-web/anchors)), the first scene understanding
      feature has been [merged](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/8e1c06511b420a30d34878c472416bd604747cb9/hit-testing-explainer.md)
      into the WebXR Device API proper. The new [hit test explainer](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/8e1c06511b420a30d34878c472416bd604747cb9/hit-testing-explainer.md)
      describes new methods that allow applications to raycast into the real-world
      and collisions conveying found geometry. Note that this proposed API differs from
      the [implementation in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/06/ar-for-the-web),
      based off of the [original proposal](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test).
